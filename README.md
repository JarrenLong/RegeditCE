RegeditCE
=========

A simple Registry Editor for Windows CE.NET devices.

## Software Requirements:
 * Windows CE 4.2, 5.0, and 6.0 (CE and PowerPC versions)
 * Windows Mobile 5.0 (PowerPC and Smartphone versions)
 * .NET Compact Framework v3.5 (.NET CF v3.5)
 * 32Kb storage space (16Kb for the application, 16Kb for the installer CAB)

## Installation using the CAB installer
RegeditCE comes with a convenient CAB file installer that can be quickly used to install the program onto your device. To use the CAB file installer:
1. Copy the CAB file for your platform onto your device. You may store this on the device's internal storage, or external storage if your device supports it (Compact Flash disk, SD card, Mini SD card, Micro SD card, etc.)
2. On your device, use the file browser to navigate to where the CAB file is stored
3. Double-tap on the CAB file (if your device has a touchscreen), or use a combination of the arrow keys/Enter key to launch the CAB file installer
4. Follow the prompts to install RegeditCE

If you would prefer to use RegeditCE as a standalone application (without installing it), you can simply copy the .EXE file anywhere onto your device, and run that file directly.
